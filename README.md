# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2024! This project contains solutions to the daily puzzles of Advent of Code.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The main language used to solve the challenges.
- **Bun**: The runtime environment chosen for this project, providing a fast and efficient way to run TypeScript code.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaeWolff/advent-of-code-2024.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the puzzles

The puzzles are organized in directories like `day-01`, `day-02`, etc. Each day contains an input.txt file and a TypeScript script to solve that day's puzzle.

To run the script for a specific day, use the following command (replace XX with the day number):

```bash
bun run day-XX/index.ts
```
